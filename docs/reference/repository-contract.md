# Repository contract

When `steer` manages a repo, it expects a known shape. `/steer:init` and
`/steer:adopt` install it; `/steer:sync` keeps it current. The scaffold is bundled
in `plugins/steer/templates/scaffold/` and mapped to install paths by its
`MANIFEST.md`.

| Element | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/spec` spine | `templates/spec/` | Product truth. See [Product spine](../concepts/product-spine.md). |
| `mise.toml` | scaffold | Toolchain pins + dev-loop tasks. |
| `mise.lock` | created at pin time | The real version pin. The scaffold ships **no** lock — `/steer:init`/`/steer:adopt` create it when they pin the toolchain (`touch mise.lock`, `mise install`, then `mise lock --platform linux-x64,macos-arm64` so the lock carries per-platform URLs + checksums — CI runs `mise install --locked` on `linux-x64`, which fails on a host-only lock). Until a populated lock is committed, CI runs a plain unlocked install; never commit an empty / comment-only lock. Run `/steer:conventions` for the full toolchain rationale. |
| CI workflows + PR template | scaffold | Quality gates and review template. |
| `compose.yaml`, README quickstart | scaffold | Local run + onboarding. Host ports are env-overridable so they don't collide across products or worktrees. |
| `.worktreeinclude` | scaffold | Carries git-ignored local config (`.env`, `.mise.local.toml`, `.claude/settings.local.json`) into each `claude --worktree` — worktrees start from git refs only, so without it the app can't boot there. |
| `scripts/worktree-env.sh` | scaffold | Sourced by `mise.toml` (`[env]._.source`) so parallel Claude Code worktrees of the same repo don't collide at runtime: it gives each worktree a unique `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` and a stable per-worktree host-port offset (`POSTGRES_PORT`, `WEB_PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`). The primary checkout gets offset 0 (ports unchanged). `mise run docker:clean` tears down a worktree's services + volumes before it is removed, scoped to that worktree. See the always-on **Parallel worktrees** rule. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | product | **Only** product-specific context — standards prose is never duplicated here. |

## Root housekeeping

The root holds scaffolding and config only — not the spreadsheets, decks,
diagrams, and **specification / requirements documents** (`.pdf`, `.docx`, decks
— specs, briefs, RFP/SOW) that feed the spec. Those are **source material**:
their home is `/spec/reference/`; architecture and flow diagrams go to
`/spec/design/`.

Steer keeps the root clean as it works. When a session notices a loose root file
it can **confidently classify**, it **moves it to the right home immediately**
(`git mv`, filename preserved) — no confirmation for a move that was never in
doubt. Confirmation is reserved for where judgment or loss is at stake:
**renaming** a cryptic name to a cleaner one is *proposed* (the file still moves
now, under its existing name); a file whose purpose or correct home is
**ambiguous** — or a `Copy of …` / look-alike pair — is **asked about** before
anything happens; and **deletion** is never automatic (only true OS junk like
`.DS_Store`, on confirmation, with a `.gitignore` pattern added). Run
[`/steer:tidy`](skills.md) for a full sweep of an accumulated pile.

## Scaffold storage convention

Scaffold dotfiles are stored in the plugin **without the leading dot**
(`gitignore`, `env.example`, `github/`, `claude/`, …) so they don't act on the
plugin repo itself. `MANIFEST.md` maps each stored file to its installed path
(adding the dot back). When a standard implies concrete scaffolding, the scaffold
bundle is updated in the **same change** as the rule.

When `/steer:init`, `/steer:adopt`, or `/steer:sync` install a scaffold file that
already exists in the target repo, they **merge additively and never clobber**:
Markdown spec files reconcile on heading/checklist anchors (`template-reconcile.sh`),
and the structured-config files — the line-based `.gitignore` / `.worktreeinclude`
and the JSON configs (`.claude/settings.json`, `biome.json`,
`tsconfig`, and the committed editor config `.vscode/extensions.json` /
`.vscode/settings.json`) — reconcile with `scaffold_reconcile.py`, which unions
JSON arrays and adds missing keys/lines without overwriting, reordering, or
removing any existing value. The array union is what lets a repo's existing
`.vscode/extensions.json` recommendations gain the scaffold's (VS Code is the
default editor; see the Stack rule / `/steer:conventions`) without losing local
additions.

The one exception is the `.claude/settings.json` `permissions` block, which
Claude Code evaluates by precedence **deny > ask > allow**. There, the same
pattern in two tiers is a contradiction rather than a choice (the
lower-precedence copy never governs), so after merging, the reconcile keeps each
permission pattern only in its most-restrictive tier and drops the others —
preventing a sync from leaving, say, `Bash(git push)` in both `allow` and `ask`,
and healing a repo already in that state. Because the surviving tier is the one
that already governed, effective behavior is unchanged.

## Versioning the contract

`/spec/.version` records the plugin version the spine was last reconciled
against. After a plugin release, `/steer:sync` applies pending structural
migrations from the ledger, reconciles additively, and re-stamps `.version`.
Ledger migrations cover the non-additive changes reconciliation cannot express
— renames and moves (`git mv`), deletions (`git rm`), and **in-file token
rewrites** (replacing a string that already exists in a materialized file, e.g.
the `e22-standards` → `steer` rebrand) — each applied read-then-propose,
never clobbering filled-in content.
